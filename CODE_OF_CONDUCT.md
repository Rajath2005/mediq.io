# MediQ Community Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders of the MediQ healthcare community pledge to make participation in our Ayurvedic healthcare platform a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community focused on improving healthcare accessibility through traditional Ayurvedic wisdom and modern technology.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all MediQ community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the MediQ community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at healthcare conferences, online events, or medical forums.
